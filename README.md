## Introduction

**PictoMaker** is a web app that translates sentences into sequences of pictograms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice

> This version of PictoMaker is **deprecated**. You can enjoy a **new, more elegant and improved version** called [PictoMaker Lite](https://github.com/mianfg/pictomaker-lite). PictoMaker Lite is a low overhead API designed to provide basic functionality, and with more features!
> 
> * Better tokenization and lemmatization.
> * More organized code.
> * Multilanguage support!
> 
> _The scripts provided here **lack documentation**, and some of the code may be written in a not-so-pretty way (as this was the first webapp that I ever implemented üòÖ). Please do not use in production. This repository has been left as-is, as I'm frankly really proud of it!_

## Features

PictoMaker includes the following features:

* **Sytactical analysis** using a natural language processing toolkit (`nltk`).

* **Syntax highlighting**, coloring the borders of each card depending on the category of the word.

* **Custom highlighting styles**: the border color can be changed.

* **Colored/uncolored pictograms**: can switch between colored pictograms and black and white pictograms.

* **Pictogram search engine**: you can change the photos using our search engine, or you can add your **custom ones** via URL.

  > **Upcoming:** Custom photo by URL is under development.

* **File export:** cards can be exported to:
  
  * PNG: single image with the entire sentence.
  
  * ZIP: individual cards, as PNG, compressed.
  
  * PDF: for printing.
  
    > **Upcoming:** PDF output is under development.

And much more! You can test it out at <https://pictomaker.herokuapp.com/>

> **Important notice:** as of the most recent update, PictoMaker only supports Spanish.
